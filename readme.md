Welcome to the first iteration of the Mania Media Tracker!

In its current stage, the website creates list items and displays a random famous quote from a movie, book, show, game, or poem.

Here's how it works: the page loads displaying a quote. You can use the New Quote button to pull a random quote from the array in the Javascript file. If you'd rather save the screen space, you can use the Hide/Show Quote button to slide the whole quote area up and out of the way. The quote area is automatically hidden on mobile screens to account for screen space, but you can use the Hide/Show Quote button to pull it back down.

The main content of the page is the list creator. You simply type a list title into the text input and click the button (or just hit enter) to create a list button! In the future, these will be saved to an account, and will each link to a brand new page. For now, though, without back-end functionality, all they do is look pretty.

That's essentially it for now! I have plans to further develop this project in the future and hope to see all of my ideas come to fruition.

Enjoy, and thanks for checking out my project!
