<!-- Main HTML for project site -->
<!-- LAPTOP GIT PATH  cd c/users/e/projects/programming/code_louisville/media_tracker -->
<!-- DESKTOP GIT PATH cd /d/projects/programming/code_louisville/media_tracker -->

<!--

Things to do:

- finish basic HTML structure (pull from small js-related snippets)
- make sure classes, ids, etc. are all good to go as css is built
- finish commenting out code
- ensure that all large sections have containers/wrappers
- create image for top-left logo
- squish code back down

- rewrite code from scratch; copypaste this into notepad,
use vertical monitor, get it allllll nice and clean

Future functionality:

- upon click, remove placeholder text from search bar and list title text input
